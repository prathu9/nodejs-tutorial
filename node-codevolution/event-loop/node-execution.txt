1) All synchronous code is executed
2) Start of event loop - Asynchronous code execution first starts with microtask
3) nextTick queue callback is executed first if present
4) Promise queue callback is executed next
5) Timer queue callback is executed next
6) Again nextTick and then Promise queue callback is executed
7) IO queue callback is executed next
8) Again nextTick and promise queue callback is executed
9) IO queue callback is executed next
10) Again nextTick and then Promise queue callback is executed
11) Check queue callback is executed next
12) Again nextTick and then Promise queue callback is executed
13) Close queue callback is executed next
14) Event loop runs agains from 2) if more callbacks are remaining

//Note: nextTick and Promise queues are executed in between each queue and also in between each callback execution in the timer and check queues
